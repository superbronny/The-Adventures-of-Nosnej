            The Adventures of Nosnej is a 2D platformer game inspired by 
            games like Super Mario and Doodle Champion Island Games. It 
            includes this website, a demo game and an animation. The 
            Adventures of Nosnej follows a player character through a 
            pixelated world of intruige and mystery. </p>

         <p> The player must collect coins and items to up their point score. 
            Gold coins are the most common collectable but as you explore
            the world you can find a variety of precious stones and weapons, 
            even flowers. </p>  

        <p>
            On this website you will find: the demo game, an animated trailer 
            and pages related to the assets used in building the game, as well 
            as proposed assets for the final edition. </p>

        <p>
            Help Nosnej find his way through this new world he has been sucked into! 
            Collect items, spend coins and explore the world he has found himself in. 
            Hopefully you'll find a way out...</p>
