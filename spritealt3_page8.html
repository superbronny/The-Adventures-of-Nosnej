        This the proposed collection of items that the player character would be able to collect. 
        Some are stylised weapons, some are just miscellaneous items. The idea being that the player can 
        trade or buy the items. Each item would have different value in the game world that would eventually
        help them find their way out of the game. These items are not part of the demo game.

        These three items are integral to the video game. The sword would help Nosnej complete tasks and
        quests that may lie ahead in his journey. The pouch will be one of the first items Nosnej will collect
        on his adventure, because it would act as his inventory for items that aren't coins and gems. The map 
        would be a level map (see image below), it would lead Nosnej to the next level or next quest.
